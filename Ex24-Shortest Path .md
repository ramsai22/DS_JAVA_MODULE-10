# Ex24 Shortest Path and Reachability in a Heritage Town using BFS

## AIM:
To design and implement a Python program that, given a map of attractions in a heritage town connected by walking paths, recommends:
The shortest number of paths (minimum hops) from a starting attraction to a target attraction.
The number of reachable attractions from the same starting point using Breadth-First Search (BFS)


## Algorithm
1. Start the program.
2. Read the number of attractions and initialize an adjacency list.
3. Read the walking paths (edges) connecting attractions.
4. Use BFS to find:

   Shortest path (minimum hops) from start node to destination node using a distance array.

   Reachability count, i.e., number of attractions reachable from the start.

5. Initialize arrays for visited and distance, and a queue for BFS.
6. Set the starting node as visited and enqueue it.
7. While the queue is not empty:
   
  Dequeue the current node.

  For each adjacent node, if not visited, enqueue it and update its distance.

8. After BFS completes:

9. Display reachable attractions and count.

10. Display the shortest distance to the destination node.

11. Stop the program.
